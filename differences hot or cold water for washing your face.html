<li>This lists the advantages of cold and warm water</li>
<li>But there are disadvatages to them both.</li>
<ul>
<p>While a steaming hot shower or face washing session can feel quite relaxing in the moment, it’s not the best option for your skin. Piping hot water can cause a heightened level of skin sensitivity and dry out your skin, stripping it of necessary natural oils. This can be incredibly unpleasant if you already have dry skin or oily skin. Oily skin could respond to having its natural oils stripped by creating even more oil—leaving you looking excessively shiny, or worse, causing an unwanted breakout.
Splashing cold water on your face will not only wake you up in the morning but also it can also act like an astringent and bring down puffiness and leave your skin feeling refreshed, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). That being said, you should try to avoid cleansing your skin with too much cold water because it does not effectively clean out the skin. Cold water tightens up your pores, which can trap bacteria and dirt into the skin.
Turn up (or down) the temperature so that it’s somewhere in between hot and cold—lukewarm is ideal. Recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology, moderately warm water will make for the best face washing experience and overall skin health. Lukewarm water can help ensure that your facial cleanser gets the right amount of foaming action, removes enough dirt from the surface of your skin, and balances your natural skin oils appropriately.
